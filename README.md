# Splurty

### Bootstrap / HTML / CSS / postgreSQL / Ruby - Ruby on Rails

Splurty is an application that allows users to generate random travel quotes.

The application stores the quotes and user data using a postgreSQL database.

For front end design the application uses the bootstrap grid system. Additional styling for colors were plucked from www.colorpicker.com and fonts from www.fontsquirrel.com.

Functionality to add a form for users to add quotes was accomplished with the SimpleForm gem and a bootstrap modal.

Validation was introduced into the model to avoid invalid user data inputs such as character limits and empty submissions.
